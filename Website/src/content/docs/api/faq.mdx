## Chat and Conversation

### How does the chat endpoint work?

To engage in a chat, send a POST request to the `/chat` endpoint with the required parameters like `prompt`, `character`, and `source`. The API will return the chatbot's response based on the input.

### Is it possible to retrieve the chat history for a specific user?

Yes, you can retrieve the chat history for a specific user by making a GET request to the `/chat-history/:userId` endpoint, providing the user's unique identifier (`userId`) in the path.

### What information does the chat history include?

The chat history includes a list of messages exchanged between the user and the chatbot. Each message has a `role` (user or assistant) and `content` (the message text).

## Image Retrieval

### How can I retrieve images based on a specified source?

Use the `/images` endpoint with a POST request, providing the `source` and `number` parameters. Additional options for customizing image retrieval can be included in the `options` parameter.

## Error Handling

### What happens if I provide an invalid API key?

If an invalid API key is provided, the API will return an error message indicating the issue. Make sure to use a valid API key for authentication.

### How does the API handle rate limiting?

The API applies rate limiting to control the number of requests. If the rate limit is exceeded, the API will respond with an error message.

## Authentication and Security

### How do I authenticate API requests?

Include the API key in the request body using the `apikey` parameter. This key is used for authentication and determining the appropriate generative model.

### How does the API handle security?

The API uses HTTPS to ensure that all requests are encrypted. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information such as API keys.
